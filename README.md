# nestjs_api_basics

Testing nestjs functionalities

## Install nestjs and create project

npm install -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project-name

## Post install actions

From src folder delete app.controller.spec.ts, app.controller.ts and app.service.ts.
Delete lines regarding AppController and AppService from app.module.ts.

## Generate module

nest g module module-name
g stands for generate. This command generates module "module-name" and automaticaly imports it into app.module.ts.

## Controllers and services

Controllers are annotated with @Controller, and services with @Injectable, both from @nestjs/common package. Then, they need to be added in module.ts file, inside @Module decorator.
Inside controller, we pass service as constructor parameter. Inside controller decorator we pass route, that needs to be combined with routes from @Post decorators over methods inside controller.
